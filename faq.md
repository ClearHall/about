## Security
> Why do you need my Skyward login?

SkyMobile works by accessing Skyward much like an ordinary user would.
We have no special or internal access to Skyward services; therefore, we must login manually with your username and password.

> How do I know you aren't going to view my grades, sign me up for seven periods of dance, and perform other mischievous deeds?

All ClearHall software is open source, allowing you to peek inside the code to make sure we aren't doing anything unusual.
